At this point,Iturned left to travel 0.85 miles while riding through the Flat Iron Mesa 4x4 Trail, then turned right to follow theFlat lron Mesa 4x4 Trail. You'll definitely spot this<br\/>trail as you will see signposts with FI' on them.<\/p><p>Then I followed the trail loop going south and turning west again.which afterward starts heading north near the rim of the famous Moab rock formation--Hatch Watch. After riding 6.7 miles,Iintersected at the Flat Iron Mesa Rd to head Northwest and enjoy the overlooking view of Kane Creek Canyon along with the breathtaking Hatch Watch Canyon.I suggest you take a break here and fill your eyes with the stunning scenery of rock formations. forests. and amazing landscapes.<\/p><p>When returning to the trailhead,Iturned right at the southeast part of the trail and headed on the Flat lron Mesa Rd for 2.3 miles. Then,Iturned left to find my way back to the trailhead. It's not that hard to find the trail's starting point since it's a loop.<\/p><p>The Flat lron Mesa trail is ideal for everyone using an e-bike and 4x4 vehicles to get the most out of enioying Moa.Utah.
